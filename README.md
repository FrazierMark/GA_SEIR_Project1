# Connect 4!

## GA - SERI - Project 1
 
## This is a javascript recreation of the classic game, "Connect 4" with an updated look.
- The is a two-player game in which players (yellow and red) take turns
dropping tokens into a 6-row, 7-column grid.
- Tokens drop to the lowest available position within the column
and begin to stack as players alternate turns.
- The first player to form a vertical, horizontal, or diagnal line
with their (yellow or red) tokens, wins!
