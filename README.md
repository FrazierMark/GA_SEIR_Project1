-The is a two-player game in which players (yellow and red) take turns
dropping tokens into a 6-row, 7-column grid.
-Tokens drop to the lowest available position within the column
and begin to stack as players alternate turns.
-The first player to form a vertical, horizontal, or diagnal line
with their (yellow or red) tokens, wins!
